DayPlanner Homework

This is a Weather app that provides current weather information and a five day weather forecast based on the city that the user provides.

There is an input field where a user can submit a city name (i.e. Las Vegas) and, once the button "search" is pushed, will return the current temperature, humidity, a 'feels like' index, and a UV index.  Below the search bar are boxes featuring the following five day forecast of the weather, providing the same details predicted for those days with surprising accuracy.  

A user can also leave and return to the page (or 'refresh' the page) and when they click inside the search box, they will see that their previous searches stay stored within local storage.
